    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p>I usually do programming at Home and University</p>
    <p>I started using computers when I was in college, so my skills are still a bit lacking, but I would be grateful if you could look at me with warm eyes</p>
    <p>I'm an inexperienced person, but I appreciate your help.</p>
